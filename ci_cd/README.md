# CI/CD Directory

This directory previously contained a GitHub Actions workflow. The canonical CI is now defined at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to ensure badges and Actions pickup work by default.

Remaining files:

- `jenkins_pipeline.groovy` (alternative CI)
- `test_matrix.json` (reference matrix)
