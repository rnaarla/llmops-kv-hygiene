# FAANGMULA-aligned Principles for KV-Cache Hygiene

This document maps the KV-cache hygiene design to established FAANGMULA practices and provides concrete, automatable checks.

## 1) Defense-in-Depth

- Multiple compensating controls: allocator isolation, sanitizer verification, forensic logging, CI/CD gates, runtime anomaly detection.
- Automatable checks
  - Allocation tagged with tenant_id/request_id; cross-tenant reuse is blocked.
  - Sanitizer attestation recorded and verified before reuse.
  - Hash-chained logs prevent silent failure.

## 2) Fail-Secure Defaults

- On uncertainty (missing attestation, unknown buffer lineage), disable reuse and quarantine.
- CI/CD blocks deploy if coverage < 99.9% or logs not tamper-evident.

## 3) Principle of Least Privilege

- Tracer/forensics write-only to append-only channel; read access is audited.
- Serving workers can emit logs but cannot erase or rewrite.

## 4) Reproducible Builds and Deterministic Ops

- Sanitization and tests are deterministic; coverage math is pure and repeatable.
- CI uses pinned Python deps and fixed seeds for fuzz harness.

## 5) Observability First

- First-class metrics: coverage, quarantine_count, anomaly_rate, allocator_reuse_rate.
- Dashboards and SLOs tied to deploy gates.

## 6) Automated Policy Enforcement

- Policy-as-code in CI/CD with machine-readable verdicts from eviction_checker.
- Merge blocked on thresholds; artifacts include evidence bundle (logs, coverage report).

## 7) Resilience and Graceful Degradation

- If hygiene fails, fallback to cache-less inference; isolate affected pools.
- Alerting integrates with incident response runbooks.

## 8) Security by Design and Static Hardening

- Memory patterns avoid partial scrub hazards (stride-aware).
- Zero-trust between tenants; pool-level isolation by default.

## 9) Privacy and Compliance by Default

- PHI/PII never written to logs; only metadata and digests.
- Retention and access control match HIPAA and FedRAMP High.

## 10) Continual Verification

- Fuzzing in CI and periodic runtime probes.
- Scheduled audits compare expected vs. actual sanitizer coverage and log integrity.

## Engineering Checklists

- Pre-commit
  - Type-check and lint pass.
  - Unit tests and coverage ≥ 95%.
- Pre-merge CI
  - Hygiene coverage ≥ 99.9%.
  - Zero unsanitized regions.
  - Forensic hash chain verified.
- Pre-deploy
  - Evidence bundle archived (coverage.json, hash_chain.json, test report).
  - Rollback plan validated.
